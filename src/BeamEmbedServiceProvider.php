/**
 * The generic embed subsystem provider (recohere T02; generalized T30). Binds the NO-OP / default
 * inversion ports so a bare beam site gets the whole REMOTE-EMBED substrate out of the box — spawn a
 * session, publish, mint a capability grant, broker + audit a call — with no grounding, which is the
 * correct posture for a substrate that has no knowledge relations. A host (tower-embed's
 * TowerEmbedServiceProvider) OVERRIDES the knowledge/scope/audit bindings AND registers its own embed
 * TYPE ('concierge') on the registry this provider stands up.
 *
 * T30: "remote embed" is now the beam-tier capability and a concrete flavour (concierge) is ONE
 * registered {@see EmbedType}. This provider registers the
 * {@see EmbedTypeRegistry} singleton with the {@see GenericEmbedType} default (deny-by-default handlers);
 * the generic {@see CapabilityBroker} dispatches to the ACTIVE type's
 * handlers, and audits through the {@see CapabilityAuditRecorder} port.
